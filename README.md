Simple and easy-to-navigate layout.
ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA (Java Persistence API)
Database: MySQL
API Testing: Postman
Version Control: GitHub

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
The project contains two main directories:

Frontend: Located in the frontend/ folder. This contains the React.js application.
Backend: Located in the src/main/java/com/library/ folder. This contains the Spring Boot application.
Hereâ€™s the folder structure:
library.management.system/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/    <-- React.js Code
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ src/main/java/com/library/  <-- Spring Boot Backend Code
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ target/    <-- Compiled JAR Files

http://localhost:8080
Since the project is running on a single port, the React app and Spring Boot API are merged using Spring Boot's embedded Tomcat server.

ðŸ“œ Notes
This project is built purely for learning purposes to demonstrate a full-stack application.
No authentication or user roles have been implemented.
The primary goal is to showcase the integration of React.js, Spring Boot, and MySQL on a single port.
